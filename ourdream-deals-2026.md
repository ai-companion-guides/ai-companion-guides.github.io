# OurDream.ai Deals in 2026: Monthly, Yearly, and Trials Compared

OurDream.ai is one of the most popular AI companion platforms in Europe and North America.  
As subscriptions became more complex in 2025–2026, users often ask which plan gives the best value.

This guide summarizes what each option typically includes.

## Monthly Plans
Monthly subscriptions offer:
- flexibility  
- easy cancellation  
- access to chat + media features  
- recurring DreamCoins  

Best for:
- first-time users  
- occasional interaction  
- short-term testing  

The downside: Monthly is usually the most expensive option per month.

## Yearly Plans
Yearly subscriptions usually offer:
- 40–60% lower effective monthly cost  
- stable pricing for 12 months  
- higher DreamCoin value  
- no interruption of long-term memory  
- predictable budget for the year

- region-specific promotions (like CE week deals)  

Trials are helpful for checking:
- model quality  
- responsiveness  
- NSFW performance

## Which Plan Should You Choose?
Choose **Monthly** if you want:
- low commitment  
- to test the platform  
- short-term casual use  

Choose **Yearly** if you:
- interact weekly  
- want stable pricing  
- rely on memory/history
