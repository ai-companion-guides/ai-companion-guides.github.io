# Why Most Users Switch to Yearly AI Companion Plans

In 2026, more AI companion users than ever before are choosing **yearly subscriptions**.  
This trend started in late 2024 and accelerated through 2025 as monthly pricing rose across the industry.

Here are the top reasons users make the switch.

## 1. Yearly Pricing Is More Stable
Monthly plans are updated more frequently.  
Yearly plans lock in the price for 12 months — even if the platform increases monthly rates.

With inflation + rising GPU compute costs, this matters.

## 2. You Get Lower Effective Monthly Cost
A typical difference:

- Monthly: $19.99  
- Yearly: $9.99 per month (billed annually)

Over 12 months, the savings add up.  
For regular users, the yearly plan often cuts the cost nearly in half.

## 3. Memory & Consistency Work Better
Long-term features such as:
- relationship memory  
- personalization  
- saved chats  
- learning preferences  

…all work better when you’re not canceling every 30 days.

## 4. No Interruptions
Monthly renewals can fail due to:
- expired cards  
- insufficient funds  
- regional billing restrictions  

Yearly avoids all of that.

## 5. Users Avoid Mid-Year Price Hikes
Many platforms raised prices in 2024 and 2025.

Yearly subscribers didn’t feel those increases.
