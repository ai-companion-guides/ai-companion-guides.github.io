# Why Most Users Switch to Yearly AI Companion Plans

In 2026, more AI companion users than ever before are choosing yearly subscriptions.
This trend started in late 2024 and accelerated through 2025 as monthly pricing rose across the industry.

Here are the top reasons users make the switch.

## 1. Yearly Pricing Is More Stable

Monthly plans are updated more frequently.
Yearly plans lock in the price for 12 months — even if the platform increases monthly rates.

With inflation + rising GPU compute costs, this matters.

## 2. You Get Lower Effective Monthly Cost

A typical difference:

- Monthly: $19.99
- Yearly: $9.99 per month (billed annually)

Over 12 months, the savings add up.
For regular users, the yearly plan often cuts the cost nearly in half.

## 3. Memory & Consistency Work Better

Long-term features such as:

- relationship memory
- personalization
- saved chats
- learning preferences

…all work better when you're not canceling every 30 days.

## 4. No Interruptions

Monthly renewals can fail due to:

- expired cards
- insufficient funds
- regional billing restrictions

Yearly avoids all of that.

## 5. Users Avoid Mid-Year Price Hikes

Many platforms raised prices in 2024 and 2025.

Yearly subscribers didn't feel those increases.
