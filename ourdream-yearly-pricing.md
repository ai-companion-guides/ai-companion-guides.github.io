# OurDream.ai Yearly Subscription: Is It Worth It in 2026?

Yearly subscriptions for AI companion apps can look expensive upfront, but for regular users they often end up being the most cost-effective option. This guide explains how the OurDream.ai yearly subscription is priced, how much users typically save compared to monthly plans, and who the yearly option is best suited for.

## How Yearly Plans Reduce Cost Over Time (with real numbers)

If you already know you'll use the platform beyond a short trial period, the yearly plan usually offers significantly better value by lowering the effective monthly price.

Based on the pricing shown at checkout (prices may change over time):

- Premium Monthly: $19.99 billed monthly
- Premium Yearly: $119.88 billed annually (equivalent to $9.99 per month)

Over a full year, the difference becomes clear:

- Monthly plan: $19.99 × 12 = $239.88
- Yearly plan: $119.88
- Estimated savings over one year: $120

For users who stay subscribed long-term, the yearly plan effectively cuts the monthly cost in half.

## What You Get With a Yearly OurDream.ai Plan

Yearly subscriptions are designed for continuity rather than short testing periods. Users typically benefit from:

- A more stable experience without monthly renewal interruptions
- Ongoing conversation history instead of frequent resets
- Better overall value if the app is used regularly

In practice, yearly plans suit users who interact consistently rather than those who only log in occasionally.

## DreamCoins and plan value

Subscriptions generally include DreamCoins that can be used for premium media features such as images, video, or audio. Monthly plans usually include a fixed amount each month, while yearly plans may include an upfront bonus in addition to recurring monthly coins.

Exact DreamCoin amounts and bonuses can change, so it's best to confirm current details on the pricing page.

## Yearly vs Monthly: Which one should you choose?

- Choose Monthly if you're only testing the platform or unsure whether you'll use it long-term.
- Choose Yearly if you already use AI companion apps regularly and want the lowest possible cost over time.

For frequent users, yearly pricing is often simpler, more predictable, and less frustrating than paying month by month.
