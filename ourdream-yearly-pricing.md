## 💰 How Yearly Plans Reduce Cost Over Time (with real numbers)

If you already know you'll use the platform beyond a short trial period, the yearly plan usually offers significantly better value by lowering the effective monthly price.

Based on the current New Year Sale pricing:

- Premium Monthly: $39.99 billed monthly
- Premium Yearly: $119.88 billed annually (equivalent to $9.99 per month) — **75% OFF**

Over a full year, the difference becomes clear:

| Plan | Total for 12 months |
|------|---------------------|
| Monthly | $479.88 |
| Yearly | $119.88 |
| **You Save** | **$360** |

For users who stay subscribed long-term, the yearly plan saves you **75%**.

## 🪙 DreamCoins and Plan Value

Subscriptions include DreamCoins that can be used for premium media features such as images, video, or audio. Monthly plans usually include a fixed amount each month, while yearly plans include an upfront bonus in addition to recurring monthly coins.

## ✅ Yearly vs Monthly: Which one should you choose?

- Choose **Monthly** if you're only testing the platform or unsure whether you'll use it long-term.
- Choose **Yearly** if you already use AI companion apps regularly and want the lowest possible cost over time.

For frequent users, yearly pricing is often simpler, more predictable, and less frustrating than paying month by month.

## 🌍 Availability in Europe

OurDream.ai is available across Europe, including Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and the Czech Republic. Pricing and payment options may vary slightly depending on location.
