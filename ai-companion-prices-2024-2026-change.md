## 💰 2024: The "Cheap AI" Era Ends

In early 2024:

- most apps were under $10/month
- image generation was slow and basic
- memory systems were unreliable
- GPU costs were low compared to demand

Free tiers still offered a lot.

But as models became heavier and media generation improved, pricing started climbing.

## 📈 2025: The Big Pricing Shift

By 2025:

- average monthly prices jumped to $15–$25
- many free tiers were removed or restricted
- apps introduced token systems
- image/video features became premium
- compute costs rose every quarter

Monthly plans rose fast — but platforms avoided touching yearly pricing.

## 🔒 2026: Users Start Locking in Yearly Plans

In 2026:

- monthly prices remain high
- yearly plans still offer 40–75% savings
- more users switch to annual subscriptions
- platforms promote yearly discounts to stabilize revenue

## 🤔 Why Prices Increased

Across all platforms, pricing changes were driven by:

- higher GPU compute cost
- more complex multimodal models
- global inflation
- demand for video and voice
- memory and personalization tech

These features require constant servers, which cost money even when users aren't chatting.

## 🔮 What to Expect Next

Through 2026, you can expect:

- more aggressive yearly discounts
- fewer "unlimited" monthly plans
- more token systems
- occasional price increases on monthly renewals

If you're planning long-term use, yearly is almost always the smarter choice.
