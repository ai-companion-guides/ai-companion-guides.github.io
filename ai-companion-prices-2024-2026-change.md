# How AI Companion Prices Changed From 2024 to 2026

Updated January 2026

AI companion apps went through one of the fastest pricing shifts of any digital industry.
Between 2024 and 2026, almost every platform increased subscription fees — especially monthly plans.

Here's a simple breakdown of what changed, why, and what users can expect going forward.

## 2024: The "Cheap AI" Era Ends

In early 2024:

- most apps were under $10/month
- image generation was slow and basic
- memory systems were unreliable
- GPU costs were low compared to demand

Free tiers still offered a lot.

But as models became heavier and media generation improved, pricing started climbing.

## 2025: The Big Pricing Shift

By 2025:

- average monthly prices jumped to $15–$25
- many free tiers were removed or restricted
- apps introduced token systems
- image/video features became premium
- compute costs rose every quarter

Monthly plans rose fast — but platforms avoided touching yearly pricing.

## 2026: Users Start Locking in Yearly Plans

In 2026:

- monthly prices remain high
- yearly plans still offer 40–60% savings
- more users switch to annual subscriptions
- platforms promote yearly discounts to stabilize revenue

## Why Prices Increased

Across all platforms, pricing changes were driven by:

- higher GPU compute cost
- more complex multimodal models
- global inflation
- demand for video and voice
- memory and personalization tech

These features require constant servers, which cost money even when users aren't chatting.

## What to Expect Next

Through 2026, you can expect:

- more aggressive yearly discounts
- fewer "unlimited" monthly plans
- more token systems
- occasional price increases on monthly renewals

If you're planning long-term use, yearly is almost always the smarter choice.

## Regional Pricing

Prices also vary by region. Users in Central Europe may see different rates depending on VAT and currency.
